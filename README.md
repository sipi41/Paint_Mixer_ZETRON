Sample created with Blazor Server and .Net Core 10.

API information is located in the https://localhost{YOUR_PORT}/swagger

V1 included only a UI mixer that limits user interaction to match to specified specifications (values 1 to 100 per color and a maximum total of 100 for all dyes)

For V2, I added a form to cancel a job. 

Thank you ZETRON
