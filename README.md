<img width="1527" height="730" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b3596e5-f426-493a-8122-bce1a78376b6" />

Sample created with Blazor Server and .Net Core 10.

API information is located in the https://localhost{YOUR_PORT}/swagger

V1 included only a UI mixer that limits user interaction to match to specified specifications (values 1 to 100 per color and a maximum total of 100 for all dyes)

For V2, I will include a form to check the status of a job and also to cancel a job. (soon)

Thank you ZETRON
